We will upload and update datasets and queries once in a while.

These datasets and queries come from either open sources or real scenarios (under desensitization).

*Datasets* cover <u>a large number</u> of typical domains, with diversified data characters (e.g., different column and tuple numbers).

*Queries* are <u>real</u>  SQL statements that cover both AI and DB applications, such as feature extraction (*![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-fe-Informational)), transactions (come soon), and analytical queries (come soon).
